#UIKit

  1. UILocalNotifications (object specifies a notification that an app can schedule for presentation at a specific date and time)
  3. UIActivityViewController (sharing between apps)

#Third party libraries

  2. [Core Plot](https://github.com/core-plot/core-plot) (library for creating 2D graphics)
  4. Compare [Mantle](https://github.com/Mantle/Mantle) and [Magical Record](https://github.com/MagicalPanda/MagicalRecord) (Serialization and mapping of JSON the data)
